# Example CLI Configuration (copy to ~/.hivemind)
# This file shows all available configuration options for the Hivemind CLI.
# The CLI uses a kubectl-style context system to manage multiple environments.

# Current active context
# Use "hivemind config use-context <name>" to switch
current-context: dev

# Named contexts
# Each context can have different server settings and rendering preferences
contexts:
  # Development context (local server in dev container)
  dev:
    server:
      # Server address (use localhost when running CLI in dev container)
      address: localhost
      # Server port (matches dev-server.yaml grpc port)
      port: 4153
    rendering:
      # Terminal markdown theme for snippet display
      # Options: "auto", "dark", "light", "pink", "notty", "dracula", "tokyo-night"
      # "auto" automatically adapts to your terminal's light/dark mode
      theme: auto
  
  # Production context (TLS-enabled server)
  prod:
    server:
      # Production server hostname
      # The CLI automatically uses TLS for non-localhost addresses
      address: hivemind.dontberu.de
      # Server name for TLS verification
      name: hivemind.dontberu.de
      # Standard HTTPS port
      port: 443
    rendering:
      # "auto" is recommended for production
      theme: auto
