# Example Web Server Configuration
# This file shows all available configuration options for the web UI server.
# Copy this file and customize it for your deployment.

# HTTP server configuration
server:
  # Host to bind to (use "0.0.0.0" to listen on all interfaces)
  host: "localhost"
  # Port to listen on
  port: 8080

# gRPC backend configuration
grpc:
  # Address of the gRPC server (host:port)
  # For local development, use "localhost:4153"
  # For Kubernetes, use the service name: "hivemind-server:4153"
  address: "127.0.0.1:4153"
  
  # TLS configuration for gRPC connection
  # The web server will automatically detect if TLS is needed:
  # - localhost connections use insecure (no TLS)
  # - Production hostnames use TLS with system certificates
  # No explicit configuration needed for most deployments

# OAuth callback configuration
oauth:
  # Redirect URI that OAuth providers redirect to after authentication
  # Must match the redirect URL configured in your OAuth provider settings
  # Examples:
  # - Development: "http://localhost:8080/auth/callback"
  # - Production: "https://hivemind.example.com/auth/callback"
  redirect_uri: "http://localhost:8080/auth/callback"

# Session management
session:
  # Session secret key for encrypting session cookies
  # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
  # IMPORTANT: Keep this secret! Used to sign session cookies.
  secret: "${SESSION_SECRET}"

# Logging configuration
logging:
  # Log level: debug, info, warn, error
  level: "debug"
  # Log format: json, text
  # json is recommended for production (structured logging)
  # text is more readable for local development
  format: "json"

# Example Production Configuration:
# In production, use environment variables for secrets and adjust settings:
#
# server:
#   host: "0.0.0.0"
#   port: 8080
# grpc:
#   address: "hivemind-server:9091"
# oauth:
#   redirect_uri: "https://hivemind.dontberu.de/auth/callback"
# session:
#   secret: ${SESSION_SECRET}
